This repository contains many resources for studying Vietnamese. It includes a pdf of Elementary Vietnamese by Như Bình Ngô. In the beginning of the textbook, there is a link to audio of the dialogues presented in the book. I have written a program to convert all of the exercises in the book to audio, for better listening practice. There are also Anki files for every vocabulary word in the glossary, with tags corresponding to which chapter they are introduced in.
